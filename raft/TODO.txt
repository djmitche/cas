  * AppendEntriesRep contains info implicitly in the context of the RPC (next_index)

## Misc

* refactor into sub-modules
* Handle message ser/de *far* better

  - don't require serde??

* candidate_id, leader fields in messages are redundant

## crate::net::tcp

* Expire outgoing messages if not sent in 500 ms or whatever
* Write messages while still monitoring for stopping
