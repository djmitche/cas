## Doc

* doc deviations from paper
  * AppendEntriesRep contains info implicitly in the context of the RPC (next_index)

## Misc

* Handle message ser/de somewhere better
* Parameterize better on item.. (currently char)
* log.last_entry(), log.next_index() instead of .len? (and move all usize <-> u64 in there)

## Server

* Be smarter about heartbeat timings (use randomization)
* Better testing framework - some way to exercise a particular function

## crate::net::tcp

* Expire outgoing messages if not sent in 500 ms or whatever
* Write messages while still monitoring for stopping
* use either net2 or nix, not both
* Figure out how to do a nonblocking connect with a socket from net2
* Make the wait state back off up to 1000ms or something
